PROBLEMS 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

--FileStream, StreamWriter and StreamReader are unmanaged resourcesm they implements IDisposable interface.

--using statement here is the best practise but also can be handled with try / finally (calling Dispose in finally) IL is the same for both cases

--there is no exception handling in the code (just rethrowing once)

--input variable is declared within different scope of its intended use (won't comile at all)

--source and target could be made arguments for program (this would make sense if console app would be use to convert from one format to another)


REFACTOR
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- This section depends of intended use of a program


If there is one and only use case and that is converting files from XML to JSON i'd probably create a few functions for that

For more formats in futere id create an interface for getting data from source and interface for writing data to destination
