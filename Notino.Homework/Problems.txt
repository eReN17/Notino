PROBLEMS 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

FileStream, StreamWriter and StreamReader are unmanaged resources they implements IDisposable interface.
using statement here is the best practise but also can be handled with try / finally (calling Dispose in finally) IL is the same for both cases

there is no exception handling in the code (just rethrowing once)

variable 'input' is declared within different scope of its intended use (won't comile at all)

source and target could be made arguments for program (this would make sense if console app would be used to convert from one format to another)
